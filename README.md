Prac – 01
AIM : Practical of Data collection, Data curation and management for
Unstructured data (NoSQL) (Hint: to be performed with CouchDB)
• What is CouchDB?
CouchDB is an open source database developed by Apache software foundation.
The focus is on the ease of use, embracing the web. It is a NoSQL document store
databse.

PRACTICAL NO:02
Aim: Practical of Data collection, Data curation and management for Large-scale
Data system (such as MongoDB)
What is Data Curation?
Data curation is management of the data lifecycle. The term is typically applied to
efforts to collect and preserve historical data. The following are common
elements of data curation.
MongoDB
MongoDB is a cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides, high
performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of
collection and document.

PRACTICAL NO:03
Aim: Practical of Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that
is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a
large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information
in the large set.
Standardization
Z=value-mean/standard deviation


PRACTICAL NO:05
Aim: Practical of Time-series forecasting Time Series
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to
extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series
forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously
observed values.
Syntax
The basic syntax for ts() function in time series analysis is –
timeseries.object.name <- ts(data, start, end, frequency)
Following is the description of the parameters used –
• data is a vector or matrix containing the values used in the time series.
• start specifies the start time for the first observation in time series.
• end specifies the end time for the last observation in time series.
• frequency specifies the number of observations per unit time.

PRACTICAL NO:06
Aim: Practical of Simple/Multiple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression
In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single
explanatory variable.

Multiple regression is a statistical technique that can be used to analyze the relationship between
a single dependent variable and several independent variables. The objective of multiple regression 
analysis is to use the independent variables whose values are known to predict the value of the single 
dependent value.


PRACTICAL NO:07
Aim: Practical of Logistics Regression Logistics Regression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the
classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the
concept of probability
What is the Sigmoid Function?
In order to map predicted values to probabilities, we use the Sigmoid function.
The function maps any real value into another value between 0 and 1. In machine
learning, we use sigmoid to map predictions to probabilities.



PRACTICAL NO:08
Aim: Practical of Hypothesis testing Theory:
Hypothesis Tests, or Statistical Hypothesis Testing, is a technique used to compare
two datasets, or a sample from a dataset.
A hypothesis test is usually composed by
• Null Hypothesis (H0, read "H zero"): states that all things remain equal. No
phenomena is observed or there is not relationship between what you are
comparing;
• Alternative Hypothesis (H1, read “H one”): states the opposite of the Null
Hypothesis.


PRACTICAL NO:09
Aim: Practical of Analysis of Variance
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an
observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic
factors and random factors.


PRACTICAL NO:10
Aim: Practical of Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is an algorithm used for supervised learning problems such as
classification or regression.

Practical No 11 
aim anova Anova
one way anova== a test tjat allows one to make comparisons between the means of three or more groups of data
in one way anova there is one independent variable

two way anova== a test that allows one to make comparisons between the means of three or more groups of data where two independent varibales are considered.
